# Punch! Kick! Block!
This is a small game that is being reworked. This was originally named spire=fire.


In this game, all assets used are either free or open-source, and I do not generate any profit from the use of these assets. I respect copyright and intellectual property rights and ensure that any resources incorporated into the game are appropriately licensed for free use. If any assets are found that require a license or payment, I will remove them promptly. Thank you for supporting and I will continue to release updated future versions.
